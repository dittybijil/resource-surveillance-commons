# Infra Controls

The Infra Controls project is designed to manage and implement controls specific
to various audit requirements, such as CC1001, CC1002, and others. This project
provides a platform for defining, applying, and tracking the effectiveness of
these controls, ensuring that your organization meets the necessary standards
for audit compliance.
